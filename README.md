First of all, great class! Thanks Mr. Nguyen. I have taken half of the ML course by Udacity, which was really disappointing, as the rationales for each ML algorithms were shallowly and vaguely touched. More focus was put on using the popular libraries for actual ML problems. So the Udacity maybe helpful if you are more interested in playing with ML models or you have already had a good understanding towards those models. 

MR. Nguyen's class, on the other hand, focuses more on understanding the algorithms of popular machine learning models, which is exactly what I am looking for.

This repo intends to contain some dumb while easier to understand ways to code out the algorithms. It is for beginners such as myself. But I also tried to include more "advanced" ways such as vectorization (only if I know how to do it).
